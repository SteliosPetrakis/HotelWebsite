This project was made as part of a job interview. It works perfectly on Google Chrome, full browser window and 
it was made to work with media queries in a 390x844 resolution. 

In order to see it you just need to download the repository and double click on index.html.

If you want to see how it works on the mobile version press F12 and then Ctrl+Shift+M and choose iPhone 12 Pro (preferably) 
or the default standard resolution.
